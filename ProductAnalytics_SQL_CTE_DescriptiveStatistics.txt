/* Code Challenge 1: Pull descriptive statistics with a CTE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Calculating Descriptive statitics for monthly revenue by product
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business Problem: 
The leadership team at your company is making goals for 2023 and wants to understand how much revenue each of the product subscriptions, basic and expert , are generating each month. 
More specifically, they want to understand the distribution of monthly revenue across the past year, 2022.

They asked the following questions:
	Q1: How much revenue does each product usually generate each month?
	Q2: Which product had the most success throughout all of last year?
	Q3: Did either product fluctuate greatly each month or was the month-to-month trend fairly consistent?

As the meeting is next day, I decided that a granular report of monthly revenue by product probably isn't the best deliverable
Instead of large table of numbers, I decided to calculate more high level: 
	the minimum, maximum, average and standard deviation of monthly revenue for each product for year 2022.
This provides quick summary of revenue and consistency that each product provided last year.

 OUTPUT:
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
| PRODUCTNAME | MIN_REV | MAX_REV | AVG_REV | STD_DEV_REV        |
------------------------------------------------------------------
| Basic       | 500     | 28000   | 13188   | 8123.763642197237  |
| Expert      | 3000    | 46000   | 18000   | 13796.134724383252 |

Analysis:

1. The Expert product had a much higher average monthly revenue than the Basic product. 
	This is likely because the Expert product costs more money due to having more features. 

2. The Expert product had a larger standard deviation. 
	This means that the Expert monthly revenues had more variability, whereas the Basic monthly revenues were more centered around the mean. 
	So although the Expert product produced more revenue on average, the Basic product was a little more consistent across the months.
