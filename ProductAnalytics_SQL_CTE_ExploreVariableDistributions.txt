/*Code Challenge 2: Explore variable distributions with CTEs

Business Problem: 
The marketing team manager at our company approached me seeking insights into the performance of their recent email campaign. 
With the campaign already launched, the manager is specifically interested in understanding the number of users who clicked the link embedded in the email.

During the project planning phase, collaboration with front-end engineers led to the creation of tracking events recorded in the "frontendeventlog" table. 
Notably, an event with "eventid=5" is logged when a user accesses a unique landing page exclusively linked to this campaign email. 
Tracking occurrences of "eventid=5" serves as the optimal method for quantifying the users who clicked the link in the campaign email.

In this scenario, and overall aggregate metric like an average can hide outliers and further insights. 
Therefore, a more nuanced approach involves calculating the distribution of the number of clicks per user. 
This means understanding how many users clicked the email link once, twice, thrice, and so forth.

It's crucial to note that the "frontendeventlog" table exclusively captures events that actually occur. 
Consequently, counting users who received the email but refrained from clicking the link necessitates additional data sources. 
For the sake of simplicity, I focused on analyzing data only for those users who actively clicked on the link, acknowledging that non-clickers were not factored into the analysis.

OUTPUT:
| NUM_LINK_CLICKS | NUM_USERS |
-------------------------------
| 1               | 3         |
| 2               | 2         |
| 3               | 1         |
-------------------------------

Analysis:
 This leads to the distribution of the "num link clicks" variable, allowing us to observe the frequency of users clicking the email link. 
 For instance, the data reveals that three users clicked the link once, two users clicked it twice, and one user clicked it three times. 
 Interestingly, it appears that approximately half of the engaged users revisit the email to click the link multiple times, be it twice or even three times. 
 These insights carry significant importance for the marketing team, providing valuable understanding of user interactions with the email link.
